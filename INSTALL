Building KSEG should be simple.

Be sure you have Qt 4.x installed.  At the command line in the
directory where you untarred kseg, run "qmake" (which creates
the Makefile) and then "make".

In order for help to work, the help file, kseg_help_en.html,
must be in the same directory as the language files (*.qm)

Good luck!
